                Subramaniaswamy's sanctum sanctorum Inscriptions indicate that the cave temple was built for Lord Shiva in 773 AD during the reign of the Pandya king Parantaka Nedunchadayan (765-815) by his general, Satan Ganapati . Among the Nayaka kings of Madurai , Veerappar (1572-1595), Thirumalai king (1623-1659) and Queen Mangammal (1689-1706) have thiruppanis in this temple. [ 1 ]
                
                Temple structure
                The sanctum sanctorum of Tiruparangunram Subramaniaswamy Temple is a cave temple. The sanctum sanctorum has five caves carved into the mountain. There are five sannidhis here namely Subramaniaswamy Sannidhi, Durgadevi Sannidhi, Karpaka Vinayar Sannidhi, Sathyakriswarar Sannidhi and Pavalkanivai Perumal Sannidhi.
                
                The drapery art and other sculptural features found in the figures of Dwarapalas at the gate of the Sathyagriswara Sannidhi are awe-inspiring. Apart from the five Sannidhis, Tiruparangundra temple has Annapurani cave temple and cave temple dedicated to Goddess Jeshta.
                
                In the Artha Mandapam, there are bas-reliefs representing incarnations of Thirumal on the rock next to the Sathyagriswarar Sannidhi and on the rock next to the Pavalkanivai Perumal Sannidhi. The 10 large pillars at the entrance of the temple show the sculptural artistry of the Nayak period. There are pillars like 'Murugan Deivanai Wedding Column'.\</p>
