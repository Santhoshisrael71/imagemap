        <p>The sand required for the construction of the Tirumala Nayak Palace was dug here by Tirumala Nayak, the king of Madurai . The king, who wanted to repair the area that was hollowed out due to sand digging, cut the area in a square shape and in 1645 [ 2 ] converted it into a Theppakulam and built a Vasantha Mandapam in the middle of it.
